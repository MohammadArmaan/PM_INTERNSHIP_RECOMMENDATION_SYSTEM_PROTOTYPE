üß† AI/ML Features
Recommendation Algorithm

Text Vectorization: Uses TF-IDF to convert skills and job descriptions to numerical vectors
Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity between user profile and internship requirements
Multi-Factor Scoring: Combines content similarity with business rules:

Skills matching (25% weight)
Content similarity (40% weight)
Location preference (20 points)
Sector preference (15 points)
Experience level matching (5 points)



Intelligent Filtering

Education Level: Ensures recommendations match qualification requirements
Skills Analysis: Identifies overlapping skills between user and job requirements
Location Matching: Prioritizes internships in preferred locations
Sector Preferences: Boosts scores for preferred industry sectors

üîí CORS Configuration
The backend is configured to accept requests from:

http://localhost:3000 (development frontend)
http://127.0.0.1:3000 (alternative localhost)

For production, update the allow_origins in app/main.py.
üì± Mobile Optimization
The interface is designed for users with limited digital exposure:

Large Touch Targets: Easy-to-tap buttons and form fields
Clear Visual Hierarchy: Important information stands out
Minimal Text: Uses icons and visual cues where possible
Responsive Design: Works on all screen sizes
Simple Navigation: Intuitive user flow

üöÄ Deployment Options
Frontend Deployment (Vercel - Recommended)
bash# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# From frontend directory
cd frontend
vercel

# Follow prompts to deploy
Backend Deployment Options
Railway (Recommended):

Push code to GitHub
Connect Railway to your repository
Set up Python service
Deploy automatically

Render:

Connect GitHub repository
Create new Web Service
Use Python environment
Set build command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set start command: python run.py

Heroku:
bash# Create Procfile in backend directory
echo "web: python run.py" > Procfile

# Deploy to Heroku
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
üåç Multi-Language Support (Future Enhancement)
To add regional language support:

Frontend: Use next-i18next for internationalization
Backend: Add language field to user profile
Data: Translate internship descriptions
UI: Add language selector component

Example implementation:
typescript// utils/i18n.ts
import { useTranslation } from 'next-i18next';

export const useI18n = () => {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();
  return { t, changeLanguage: i18n.changeLanguage };
};
üîß Environment Variables
Frontend (.env.local)
bashNEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
Backend (.env)
bashAPI_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000

üêõ Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Backend won't start:

Check if Python virtual environment is activated
Verify all dependencies are installed: pip list
Check if port 8000 is available

Frontend can't connect to backend:

Ensure backend is running on port 8000
Check CORS settings in app/main.py
Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL environment variable

No recommendations returned:

Check backend logs for errors
Verify CSV data is loaded properly
Ensure at least one skill and sector is provided

Module import errors:

Check Python path: python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
Verify virtual environment: which python

Debug Mode
Backend Debug:
bash# Add to run.py
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True, log_level="debug")
Frontend Debug:
bash# Add to next.config.js
module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  logging: {
    fetches: {
      fullUrl: true,
    },
  },
}
üìà Performance Optimization
Backend Optimizations

Caching: Implement Redis for frequent queries
Database: Move from CSV to PostgreSQL/MongoDB
Async Processing: Use background tasks for heavy ML operations
Load Balancing: Use multiple server instances

Frontend Optimizations

Code Splitting: Implement dynamic imports
Image Optimization: Use Next.js Image component
Caching: Implement SWR or React Query
Bundle Analysis: Use @next/bundle-analyzer
